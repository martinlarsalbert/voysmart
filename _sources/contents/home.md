##  <span style = "color:blue; font-weight: 500; font-size: 25px;">1, Objectives of our research activities:</span> 
> - Develop models to estimate a ship's fuel consumption and maneuverability
> - Develop models to describe the spatio-temporal correlation of metocean conditions encountered by ships
> - Develop optimization algorithms to plan a ship's voyage with reduced fuel/emissions and enhanced safety & ETA
> - Develop innovative measures to increase ship energy efficiency
> - Develop control algorithms to automatically navigate a ship
