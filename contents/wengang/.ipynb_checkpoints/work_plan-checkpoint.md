- One demo for EcoSail Training simulator

### E-Nav project
- Update the E-Nav training platform (can be done together with the USV platform)
- Dynamic performance prediction (upcoming papers must acknowledge the E-Nav project)
- Validation of models for measurement from more ships

### Vattenfall project
- Implement RNN algorithm/method for high-frequency time series prediction (Urgent!!)
- Arrange a meeting with Vattenfall to ensure the data access
- Plan 1/2 papers from the project duties

### VIA KAIZEN project
